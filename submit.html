        <h1>Submit a thing!</h1>
        <p>Okay so, I don't have a formal process or a nice form or anything yet,
        but that doesn't mean I don't take submissions! If you're familiar with GitHub,
        the easiest/fastest way to submit things is by forking <a href="https://github.com/cincodenada/size-of-things">this project</a>
        and submitting a pull request to add your YAML file to an appropriate folder in
        <code>images/</code> - to do so, fork the project with the button in the upper-right,
        which will create a copy of the repo under your account. Then you can add files right
        in the GitHub web interface with the "Add File" dropdown, and create a pull request
        to merge your changes into the main repo.</p>

        <p>If you're not familiar with GitHub and that all sounds like nonsense, no worries! You can always just <a href="mailto:sizeofthings@cincodenada.com">email me the info</a>
        as well and I can get it set up. Or if you want to learn about how GitHub works, shoot me
        an email or a DM or whatevs.</p>

        <p>In either case, you can see an example of the info I need (and the format of the YAML if you're doing a Pull Request)
        by looking at <a href="https://github.com/cincodenada/size-of-things/commit/4682c99ec01b4897353576c320ce7f0f4216d7f0">this commit</a>
        on GitHub. Namely, I need:
        <ul>
            <li>Category (TV show, book, fictional universe, etc)</li>
            <li>Name</li>
            <li>Credit and source URL for the image</li>
            <li>One of height/width/length of the thing (in meters)</li>
            <li>An image of the thing, preferably cropped and cut out with a transparent background</li>
            <li>Optionally, a short blurb/other descriptive info. I don't have a place for descriptions yet, but it's good to plan ahead!</li>
        </ul>
        If the image isn't cut out I can probably do it myself, but it'll take me longer to get around to it.</p>
        <p>Also, I of course reserve sole discretion in what I do and don't put up - I don't anticipate having
        to reject any well-intentioned submissions, but this is the internet, so heaven knows what y'all will come up with.</p>
        <p>Thanks for reading, and if you have any questions, feel free to let me know!</p>
