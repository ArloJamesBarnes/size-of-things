  Description: '"The Dyson Sphere was constructed over a million years ago by an unknown
    race, and abandoned several thousand years ago, presumably due to instability
    in the central star. The carbon-neutronium shell is approximately 2500 metres
    thick, and is presumed to contain circulation equipment for the Class-M environmental
    systems as well as artificial gravity and power generators, but this is an as-yet
    untested hypothesis, since only limited access has been gained and sensors are
    unable to penetrate the material. The upper atmosphere polarises to provide an
    artificial day/night cycle of 15.4 hours of light and 10.2 hours of darkness."
    From here.'
